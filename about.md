I'm a fugitive of three Math University Faculties now making a life as a Professional Software Developer, Sr. Procrastinator and Jr. Father.

I have 6+ years of experience developing mostly web applications using C# and javascript.

I love to solve problems and I like to participate in all kind of programming contests.

Currently I'm working as a Software Developer for the United Nations Office in Vienna.
